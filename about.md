This is the personal website of Jessica Reel, hosted at [jreel.github.io](http://jreel.github.io).

This website, like most other things in my life (and my life itself), is a Work-In-Progress.

The site is build using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), with the [Hyde theme](https://github.com/poole/hyde) by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo) as a basis.
